\section*{Conclusion and Discussion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All basic instances were successfully solved
        \item GI-problem could efficiently be solved for:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item graphs were the complement is smaller
            \item trees
            \item graphs with modules
            \item disconnected graphs
        \end{itemize}
        \item Number of automorphisms had only a smart algorithm for graphs with modules
        \item Bug in the detection of isomorphic graphs with disconnected components
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Possible improvements}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Optimisation for fast colour refinement after branching
    \item Use smart branching
    \item Use efficient algorithms for different types of graphs for the number of automorphisms
    % \item Smart tree-graph handling while counting automorphisms
    % \item Use disconnected graphs to increase speed in counting automorphisms
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reflection}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Development of different good ideas in parallel does not guarantee good results
    \item However, the team effort ultimately resulted in a successful integration
  \end{itemize}
